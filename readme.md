# sass-helpers: a SASS mixin library

This library includes a bunch of mixins that you'd frequently use while working with SASS. Common, monotonous tasks like providing vendor tags have already been sorted out for you. Just `@import` and enjoy.

## Installation

Clone this repo into your SASS directory. In your SASS file that needs the mixins, place this line at the top:

	@import '_helpers';

Done! SASS will automagically know that it's a .scss file and will concatenate it with your outputted code.

## Documentation

Actual documentation coming soon. Instructions are currently within the library.
